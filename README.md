shorewall_reloaded Cookbook
===========================

Description
-----------

This cookbook is based on the original in the Chef Supermarket by [charles-dyfis-net](https://supermarket.chef.io/users/charles-dyfis-net) for CentOS.

[Shorewall](http://shorewall.net/) is a rather comprehensive and easy-to-use abstraction layer on top of iptables.

This cookbook installs, configures and manages Shorewall.

Requirements
------------

#### Chef
Tested on 11.12.8 but newer and older version should work just fine.

#### Platform
The following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the recipes run on these platforms without error:
- `Ubuntu`
- `Debian`

Capabilities
------------

It supports shorewall4 and shorewall5, please see the recipes below.

Creates pretty Shorewall configuration files intended to be aesthetically
comparable to hand-written ones.

Recipes
-------

### shorewall_reloaded::default
This cookbook installs and configures shorewall on the your node. The configuration version is derived from default[:shorewall][:version]

### shorewall_reloaded::shorewall_any
the same as default, do not really use this di

### shorewall_reloaded::shorewall5
Forces a shorewall5 based configuration (overrides default[:shorewall][:version]). 
This will not ensure you actually do install the right binary, see shorewall5_apt_fix below

### shorewall_reloaded::shorewall5_apt_fix
(Yet debian jessie only) Ensure proper sources are added to install the shorewall 5.x package

Usage
-----

Just include `shorewall_reloaded` in your node's `run_list`:

```json
{
  "name":"my_node",
  "run_list": [
    "recipe[shorewall_reloaded]"
  ]
}
```

You need to set the zones, policies, rules, zones, interfaces in order to manage Shorewall by using this cookbook.

Examples:

- Setting zones:

```json
"shorewall": {
  "zones": [
    { "zone": "fw", "type": "firewall" },
    { "zone": "lan", "type": "ipv4" },
    { "zone": "net", "type": "ipv4" }
  ]
}
```

- Setting policies:

```json
"shorewall": {
  "policy": [
    { "source": "fw", "dest": "all", "policy": "ACCEPT" },
    { "source": "lan", "dest": "fw", "policy": "REJECT", "log": "DEBUG" },
    { "source": "all", "dest": "all", "policy": "REJECT" }
  ]
}
```

- Setting interfaces

```json
"shorewall": {
  "interfaces": [
    { "zone": "net", "interface": "eth0", "broadcast": "detect", "options": "tcpflags,nosmurfs,routefilter,logmartians" },
    { "zone": "lan", "interface": "eth1", "broadcast": "detect", "options": "tcpflags,nosmurfs,routefilter,logmartians" }
  ]
}
```

- Setting rules

```json
"shorewall": {
  "rules": [
    {
      "description": "Don't allow connection pickup from the net",
      "action": "Invalid(DROP)", "source": "net", "dest": "all"
    },
    {
      "description": "Accept DNS connections from the firewall to the network",
      "action": "DNS(ACCEPT)", "source": "fw", "dest": "net"
    },
    {
      "description": "Accept NTP connections from the firewall to the network",
      "action": "NTP(ACCEPT)", "source": "fw", "dest": "net"
    },
    { 
      "description": "Incoming SSH to firewall", 
      "source": "all", "dest": "fw", "proto": "tcp", "dest_port": 22, "action": "ACCEPT" 
    },
    {
      "description": "Accept HTTP/HTTPS connections to internet",
      "action": "Web(ACCEPT)", "source": "fw", "dest": "net"

    {
      "description": "Allow Ping from the local network",
      "action": "Ping(ACCEPT)", "source": "loc", "dest": "fw"
    },
    {
      "description": "Drop Ping from the \"bad\" net zone.. and prevent your log from being flooded..",
      "action": "Ping(DROP)", "source": "net", "dest": "fw"
    },
    {
      "description": "Drop Ping from the \"bad\" net zone.. and prevent your log from being flooded..",
      "action": "ACCEPT", "source": "fw", "dest": "loc", "proto": "icmp"
    },
    {
      "description": "Drop Ping from the \"bad\" net zone.. and prevent your log from being flooded..",
      "action": "ACCEPT", "source": "fw", "dest": "net", "proto": "icmp"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Setting tunnels:

"shorewall": {
  "tunnels": [
    { "type": "ipsec", "zone": "net", "gateway": "0.0.0.0/0", "gateway_zones": "vpn" }
  ]
}  
```

  "masq": [
    { "interface": "eth0", "source": "192.168.0.0/24" }

Configuration
-------------

The following is a typical example of output (in this case, for a rules file):
